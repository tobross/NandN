        description: "<p>During our first session, the band of adventurers all responded to a post requesting help with a delivery through a bandit ridden area. Your acquaintance Gundren Rockseeker and his retired fighter companion Sildar Hallwinter offered to pay you each 10g to deliver a wagon of supplies from Neverwinter to the small mining town of Phandelver.</p><p> Your patrons then left out ahead of you.</p><p> 3 days into the journey you found their horses, filled with goblin arrows and were ambushed upon inspecting them.</p><p> After the confrontation, you notice a narrow path heading into the woods. It lead to the mouth of a cave where 3 not-so-stealthy goblins lie in wait to ambush you again. While two of them were easily dispatched, the third ran deep into the cave up the path of a small stream... making a rediculous amount of noise...</p><p> The party follows and steps into a side room where they befriended three wolves that were chained to stalagmites and manage to free one, henceforth known as Trogdorg. Traveling up the main cave passage. You notice a steep gravelly path to the left and further a wooden bridge passes above you.</p><p> A loud goblin HONK! YEAAAAAH! followed by wood on wood thunking let's you know you've been seen. The water in the corridor begins to rise rapidly. The rogue deftly backflips off a wall onto the high bridge above l, helping the wizard up. The heavily geared cleric and tired wolf are swept back out of the cave, meeting every large rock along the way.</p><p> After rejoining, and being helped up into the bridge, the party moves quietly into the darkened doorway of Yeemik and his band cooking over a low fire with zero ventilation... hard to see.</p><p> Between the cleric and the wizard, they manage to convince the majority of the goblins that there is an earthquake and listen as they flee from the far door.</p><p>  Entering the room they are greeted by the sight of Yeemik using Sildar Hallwinter as a foot stool. He proposes a trade, Sildar for the death of the current goblin leader, Klarg! A vicious bugbear who runs the current operation with his ...massive intellect...</p><p> The party agrees and sets off back across the bridge toward the main chamber. Before they arrive at the throne room, the party must cross the trap room, where there are two goblins looking down the lower path waiting to see if the party will attempt to come up again, at which point they will drain the second of two large pools of stored water to flush them out a second time.</p><p> The party surprises them and leaves their bloody corpses in the still full pool before continuing on.</p><p>       As the party enters the throne room, they are greeted by several goblins, Klarg, a massive bugbear, and a very defensive Dire Wolf. A surprise shot lands a dead goblin on top of the fire in the room, casting it into darkness that the rogue uses to his advantage, throwing sneak attacks while the cleric, being the most armored is pummeled by Klarg. The dire wolf attempts to intimidate Trogdorg, but fails because of his newfound confidence in allies.</p><p> Klarg knocks the cleric unconscious, the dire wolf renders Trogdorg unconscious and begins to wail and mourn a fallen member of it's pack, leaving itself open to the rogue and wizard to finish the job on both of them! The party barely survives.</p><p> After stabilizing, the party finds 3 crates marked with a blue lion shield in the back of the cave, sever Klarg's head as evidence of his demise, and head back to Yeemik.</p><p> Proof is given and Yeemik back away from Sildar, leaving his minor throne.. that ends up being a stolen chamber pot filled with healing potions. Which if course the party confiscates.</p><p> The party returns to their wagon with Sildar and complete their journey to Phandalin. Where they seek lodging at the Stonehill Inn by Sildar's recommendation.</p>",

        description: "<p>When last we left our heroes...</p><p>The party found rest at the Stonehill Inn upon Sildar Hallwinter's suggestion. The following morning, Sylfine and Nifee wake, excitedly heading to Barthen's Provisions, knowing that they will be paid for their delivery.</p><p>Sylfine steps onto the street, arms wide waiting for Trogdorg's over-excited love and is disappointed when she is not the recipient. Rather; a very burly Dwarf is bouncing on all fours with Trogdorg and neither pays her any mind.</p><p>Eventually, the two notice they are being watched, and the dwarf introduces himself as Brunhildo, a barbarian from the mountains. He compliments their choice in companions and asks if they have seen Gundren Rockseeker.</p><p>The party replies in the negative, conveying that they were originally meant to meet him at Barthen's Provisions to deliver this cart of goods. Brunhildo decides to come along.</p><p>As we get to Barthen's Provisions and meet its proprietor, Barthen, unsurprisingly, the party recants the story of just how difficult the delivery was. They eventually make the trade.</p><p>Barthen looks anxious as he asks where your patron is. For he was looking forward to Gundren's arrival as well. Brunhildo is taken aback that Gundren is not already there.</p><p> Sylfine and Nifee describe the scene on the Triboar Trail and in the cave again, this time explaining that the horse was the only sign of Gundren that they have seen since they left Neverwinter.</p><p>Barthen is saddened by the news of Gundren's apparent capture. He encourages the party to find him, telling them of his two brothers, Tharden and Nundro Rockseeker who, come to think of it, he hasn't seen in a tenday either. They said they were camping outside of town last he heard.</p><p></p>Barthen was excited to talk to his friend Gundren about discovering the lost mine of the Phandelver's Pact in the nearby hills.</p><p>      The party asks Barthen about the other crates they found in the Cragmaw Hideout, marked with the Blue Lion on a shield.</p><p>He doesn't have any idea what might be in them, but knows that there is another store in town by the name of the Lionshield Coster and that the party might have more luck there.</p><p>We leave Barthen's Provisions and head to the Lionshield Coster, where we find Linene Graywind, the proprietor of the establishment.</p><p>The party shows the crates to her to which she reacts with astonishment and apprehension. Until the party describes how they came to be in posession of the crates, Linene is under the impression that they are the bandits who stole them in the first place!</p><p>      Not to be fooled, Linene demands that the party open the crates and show her what they contain, something they themselves never thought to do until now... before she will take them.</p><p>Upon opening, they find the crates filled with weapons and armor, standard adventuring provisions.</p><p>Quickly, Linene tosses 50GP on the counter for the party, slides a shelf to the side, revealing a store room, and shuffles the crates into the back room. When the party asks about the need for such secrecy, she replies that the Redbrands would be even more of a handful if they knew they could just turn up here and take whatever gear they needed from her shop. She advises the party to avoid the Sleeping Giant Taphouse, known for being a Redbrand gathering place.</p><p>The party steps back out onto the street and are immediately confronted with four men, wearing worn blood red cloaks. 'Time for you to move on, strangers. Give us your stuff, and be on your way!' - one says. The party, evenly matched in numbers, is able to take care of the bandits handily at first, but as the third falls, felled by a loss of foot, the last standing bandit makes a break for it and is around a corner before the party can do anything about it. Brunhildo takes one of the cloaks for himself. A free wearable blanket is nothing to turn down!</p><p>Hearing the commotion, a corpulent man, quickly waddles out of the large building on the corner and up to the party. He introduces himself as Harbin Wester, the mayor of this town and scolds you for causing more trouble with the Redbrands! The party thinks very little of him and his ability to protect his townspeople from the threat, there's even a take of someone being killed in broad daylight by them, and yet the mayor does nothing!</p><p>Harbin tries to divert the subject onto a 'greater threat' of a rumor of an orc warband that haas been seen at the end of the Triboar Trail and \"if you want to do something to help this town, do something about those orcs instead!\"</p><p>The party is not dissuaded by his feeble attempt to regain posture, but decides to leave him in the street and continue their errands, moving now to the Edermath Orchard, where they meet the retired adventurer, Daran Edermath.</p><p>The party shortly learns why he is retired. he is an old coot who thinks the best way to fight the Redbrands is to throw apples at them! He tells the party that he used to be a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, a vigilant group who seeks to protect others from the depredations of evildoers! Daran wants to see the Redbrands get what's coming to them and encourages the party by telling them that he thinks they keep coming from the East, over by the big manor house at the edge of town.</p><p>One more stop to make, the party departs from Daran's company and takes the trip to the Alderleaf farm to speak with Carp about his discovery. They walk up to the fence at the edge of the farm. Quelline Alderleaf, Carp's mother asks them if there's something she can do for them to which they reply that they are here to speak with Carp about the discovery he made in the woods. Quelline turns a scowl on Carp that could wilt flowers and scolds him profusely for putting himself in so much danger. If anyone were to find out that he knew any such Redbrand secret, the farm would be razed in short order, for sure!</p><p>The party assures her that if Carp is able to show us where the passage is, there will be no more Redbrand trouble at all!</p><p>She is relived to hear this and, since it is getting late, requests that the party return the next day to start their trip.</p><p>We return to the Stonehill Inn for another night of rest, meeting up with Sildar Hallwinter again and telling their tale over pints. Sildar has been at the town hall all day discussing the towns problems with Harbin and how to tackle them. During these discussions, Sildar learned that his former compatriot Iarno Albrek, disappeared while exploring the area around Tresendor Manor and that if the party insists on going, to keep a look out for any signs of him, or what's left of him. Iarno is a short, dark-bearded, human in his thirties.</p><p>The next day, the party gathers their things and heads to the Alderleaf farm right off. Carp shows them the hole in the stone wall at the edge of their farm and tells them that the tunnel is just through the woods here.</p><p>   Using his keep sense of smell, Brunhildo determines that there is some still water in the direction that they are headed and is able to lead them to an opening in the side of a burm up against the property line of Tresendor Manor.</p><p>The party heads inside where they find a cavernous area with a chasm on the right of them, two large stone pillars holding the ceiling up, and several hallways leading out of this room.</p><p>Whispers fill their minds, whispers eminating from nowhere and everywhere all at once. They talk of food, the next meal, and giddy cackles, explaining that people with red covers like the short one has usually bring food! It's been a long time since the last meal. The party speaks with the voice and tells it that things have changed. No longer will the red cloaked people bring the food. From here on, they -are- the food. Brunhildo removes his cloak and lays it on the ground, mourning it's loss.</p><p>The party speaks to the room saying that they will bring it's next meal shortly. Then, they cross the first bridge, noticing a half-eaten body in the chasm, and head down the closest hallway.</p><p>This hallway is reasonably long but abruptly ends with no outlet. Not taking no for an answer, the party invesigates the wall and finds a handle behind a loose brick and pulls the hidden door open, seeing a flowing cistern fountain and two sets of stairs leading up to a door on the far end of the room.</p><p>Inside, they investigate the cistern while filling their waterskins and notice something floating half way up from the bottom of this 10 foot deep pool. Brunhildo jumps in and uses his handaxe to cut the rope attaching it to the bottom. A bag floats to the top and, inside has 1 healing potion, 1 potion of invisibility, a set of common clothes, fit for an adult human, and 50gp. The ladies decide to give the 50gp to Brunhildo, who, until this point has had no decent amount of currency to get what he wants out of life. Nifee takes the invisibility potion, and Sylfine takes the waterproof bag and the healing potion.</p><p>The party then investigates the crates and barrels in the room. Using Nifee's crowbar from their dungeoneering kit, but not knowing how it works, Sylfine and Nifee bang on the crates and barrels with it like a club. Brunhildo uses his immense strength and grabs the visible handle on the top of them, opening them with a loud creak of nails coming free from wood. Inside there is an abundance of hard tack and a jar of pickles. Trogdorg seems more interested in the barrel and as Brunhildo opens it, we all find out why. It's filled to the lid with well made cured sausages! Each member eats one immediately, including Trogdorg. And stores a rope of them in their respective packs for later.</p><p>Thinking that this would make a good meal, Brunhildo takes the barrel into the large cavern, sets it down, and covers it with the red cloak he left there, then backs away, returning to the party.</p><p>Sylfine and her companions head up the stairs to invesigate the door at the top. She is the first through it, discovering that this is the intentional entrance to this cellar, seeing nothing but a walkway and trees before her, and noticing that she is indeed above ground again.</p><p>While this is happening, the party hears a muffled shout from inside, three bandits heard the noise they were making and snuck into the room while their backs were turned. Unfortunately for them, they were not smart enough to get within striking distance before shouting... They spend their surprise round running up stairs. Before the bandits knew what hit them, they were defeated, chopped, frozen, and thrown down stairs, they didn't stand a chance.</p><p>Feeling underprepared for the challenges that might await them, the party then decides to venture back to the edge of the Alderleaf farm to camp for the night, dropping off the bodies of fallen redbrands on the way there.</p><p>Before they could leave, however, a large frog-like beast with a vicious maw and one giant eye on it's forhead shows itself and, with the hopes of getting even more food, informs the group that these bandits are lead by someone they call Glasstaff, that somewhere around in these rooms, near the old crypt, there is more food, and shuddering, he has heard rumors of a \"hideous eye beast\" somewhere in this cellar! Frightening!</p>",
